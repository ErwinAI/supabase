### Destinations and Behavior

HTTP requests will be batched with a max of 250 items with at most 1 second intervals. Gzip compression will also be used if the 3rd party provider supports it.

#### Datadog

Logs sent to Datadog will have the name of the log source set on the `service` field of the event.

The payload message will be a stringified JSON of the raw log event, prefixed with the event timestamp.
